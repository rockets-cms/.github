> ðŸšš The goal is to ship small features, quickly, and frequently.

In order to do this we need to break our features down into smaller units of work and `ðŸ¤– automate` as much as possible. Testing should remain easy to setup, consistent with production, and enable rapid iteration. Local development should mirror our production environment as closely as possible.

1. Create a _feature-branch_ based on `main`
2. Create a PR and leave setting it to `draft` mode
   1. This will give us a deployment connected to `staging`
3. Pull Request review process
   1. Take it out of `draft` mode
   2. Assign a reviewer or two
   3. Address feedback, learn and teach
4. Merge into main
   1. This will automate the deployment
   2. Watch Sentry for any new errors
   3. Validate the change on production

## ðŸŒ´ Branches

We've chosen to make use of the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) when working with Git.

- **main**
  - The source of truth, this is `live/production` code
  - All features are branched off of the main branch
- **xxxxx**
  - `feature/development` branches will connect to `staging` data
  - These should be highly `disposable` and the default approach
